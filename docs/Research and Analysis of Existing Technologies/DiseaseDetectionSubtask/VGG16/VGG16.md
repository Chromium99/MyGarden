**Description:**
VGG16 and VGG19 are deep convolutional neural networks developed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at Oxford University. The main difference between them is that VGG19 has 19 layers (compared to VGG16's 16), offering slightly improved accuracy at the cost of increased computational resources.

**Strengths:**
- Simple architecture with a uniform structure (stacked convolutional layers).
- Proven to perform well on image classification tasks.
- Good at extracting detailed features from images.
  
**Weaknesses:**
- Large model size and computationally expensive.
- Can suffer from overfitting if not properly regularized.

**Applicability:**
- Great for feature extraction in plant disease recognition.
- Suitable for image classification tasks where accuracy is more important than inference speed.
