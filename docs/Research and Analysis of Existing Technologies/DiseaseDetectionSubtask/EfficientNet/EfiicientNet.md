**Description:**
EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural networks that balance **depth**, **width**, and **resolution** in a more systematic and efficient way. The architecture is designed to optimize performance while using fewer resources. Itâ€™s known for delivering **state-of-the-art accuracy** with a relatively smaller model size.

**Strengths:**
- High accuracy with fewer parameters compared to traditional CNNs.
- Scales well, offering different model sizes for various resource constraints.
- More efficient than traditional models (e.g., VGG, ResNet).

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires careful tuning of the scaling factors to balance accuracy and efficiency.
- Newer architecture, so not as widely implemented or understood as ResNet or VGG.

**Applicability:**
- Suitable for mobile apps and edge devices due to its lightweight nature.
- Works well for both image classification and feature extraction tasks.
