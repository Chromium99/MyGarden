  The goal of Planterbox is to create an AI-powered mobile application that helps users identify plants, provide care instructions, track plant growth, and offer gardening recommendations. 
  
  The research aims to address the following problems:
  - Accurate plant identification using image recognition.
  - Generating personalized care instructions based on plant species and environmental conditions.
  - Tracking plant growth and providing insights to improve gardening skills.
  - Continually training an ML model that we develop.

  The application targets plant enthusiasts, beginner gardeners, and botanists who need a reliable tool to identify plants, learn about their care, and track their progress. The significance lies in making plant care accessible and enjoyable for everyone with the help of technology. Providing the typical member of the household the ability to nurture and care for their plants is the goal of Planterbox.

  The research will focus on:
  - AI-powered plant identification using image recognition.
  - Data collection and preprocessing for training the AI model.
  - Integration of care instructions and lifecycle information.
  - Development of a growth tracking system and gardening recommendations.

  Limitations:
  - Mainly focusing on common house plant species.
  - Potential to run into financial complications when the app is deployed
  - Ability to chart and document growth stages
