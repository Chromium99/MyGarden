**Description:**

YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) is a real-time, anchor-free object detection model developed by Ultralytics. It improves upon previous YOLO versions with a simplified architecture and supports tasks like object detection, image segmentation, and classification.

**Strengths:**
- Extremely fast and accurate, even on complex backgrounds.
- Flexible: works for object detection, segmentation, and pose estimation.
- Active development and strong community support.

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires more computational resources than lightweight models like MobileNet.
- Larger model sizes can make deployment on low-end devices challenging.

**Applicability:**
- Used to detect and isolate plants from cluttered or natural backgrounds.
- Can support real-time detection in mobile/web apps with GPU acceleration.
