## Research and Analysis of Existing Technologies

# 1. Problem Definition and Scope

  The goal of Planterbox is to create an AI-powered mobile application that helps users identify plants, provide care instructions, track plant growth, and offer gardening recommendations. 
  
  The research aims to address the following problems:
  - Accurate plant identification using image recognition.
  - Generating personalized care instructions based on plant species and environmental conditions.
  - Tracking plant growth and providing insights to improve gardening skills.

  The application targets plant enthusiasts, beginner gardeners, and botanists who need a reliable tool to identify plants, learn about their care, and track their progress. The significance lies in making plant care accessible and enjoyable for everyone with the help of technology.

  The research will focus on:
  - AI-powered plant identification using image recognition.
  - Data collection and preprocessing for training the AI model.
  - Integration of care instructions and lifecycle information.
  - Development of a growth tracking system and gardening recommendations.

  Limitations:
  - Mainly focusing on common house plant species. 

# 2. Project Division into Subtasks

  **Subtask 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing**
  
  **Description:**
  Collect and preprocess a high-quality dataset of plant images and associated metadata. This dataset will be used to train the AI model for plant identification and care recommendations.
  
  **Relevance:**
  The accuracy of the AI model depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset. Proper preprocessing ensures the data is clean, labeled, and ready for training.

  **Subtask 2: AI Model Development and Evaluation**
   
  **Description:**
  Develop an AI model for plant identification using image recognition. Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it for accuracy and efficiency.
  
  **Relevance:**
  The AI model is the core of the application, allowing users to identify plants and receive care instructions. Its performance will impacts user satisfaction.
