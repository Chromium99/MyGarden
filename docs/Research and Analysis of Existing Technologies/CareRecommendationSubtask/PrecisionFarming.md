## Precision Farming

**Description:**

Precision Farming uses advanced technologies such as IOT, Data Mining, Data Analytics, Machine Learning to collect the data, train the systems and predict the results.

**Strengths:**
- Tailor recommendations based on exact soil, weather, and plant conditions.
- Detects early stress signs before visible symptoms appear on the plant.
- Works for both small gardens and large farms.

**Weaknesses:**
- Initial costs needed for sensors, drones, and AI models.
- Overkill for casual users as it is better suited for commerical agriculture.

**Applicability:**
- Soil mositure sensors for watering schedule.
- Detecting early infections for disease prevention.
