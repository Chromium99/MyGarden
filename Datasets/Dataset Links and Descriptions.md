Open Plant Image Archive - https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/opia/datasets

Source: The Open Plant Image Archive (OPIA) is hosted by the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) and can be accessed at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/opia/datasets. 
It serves as a comprehensive repository of plant images and related phenotypic data, collected from high-throughput phenotyping platforms across various species. 

Description: OPIA offers a diverse collection of 57 datasets encompassing over 571,824 images and 2,422,785 labels, covering 11 species and 6 tissue types. These 
datasets are curated to support a wide range of computer vision tasks, including image classification, detection, and segmentation, facilitating research in plant 
phenotyping and smart agriculture. 

Usability: Researchers and developers can utilize OPIA's datasets to train and evaluate machine learning models for various applications, such as plant counting, 
disease detection, and trait analysis. The archive provides detailed metadata for each dataset, including species information, tissue types, imaging sensors, and 
potential applications, enabling users to select datasets that best fit their research needs. Additionally, OPIA offers tools for image preprocessing, such as

TensorFlow Datasets - https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_leaves?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Source: The Plant Leaves dataset is available through TensorFlow Datasets and can be accessed at https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_leaves.

Description: This dataset comprises 4,502 high-resolution JPEG images of plant leaves, categorized into 22 classes based on species and health status. Each 
image is labeled to indicate whether the leaf is healthy or exhibits signs of disease, facilitating research in plant pathology and automated disease detection. 
It's important to note that there are no files with the label prefix '0000'; thus, label encoding is shifted by one (e.g., a file with label prefix '0001' corresponds 
to encoded label 0). 

Usability: The Plant Leaves dataset is well-suited for training and evaluating machine learning models in tasks such as image classification and disease detection in 
plants. Its high-resolution images and detailed labeling make it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in agriculture and computer vision. The dataset 
is readily accessible through TensorFlow Datasets, allowing for seamless integration into TensorFlow workflows.



Mendeley Data - https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hb74ynkjcn/1

Source: The dataset titled "A Database of Leaf Images: Practice towards Plant Conservation with Plant Pathology" is hosted on Mendeley Data and can be accessed 
at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hb74ynkjcn/1.

Description: This dataset comprises 4,503 high-resolution images of leaves from twelve economically and environmentally significant plant species, including Mango, 
Arjun, Alstonia Scholaris, Guava, Bael, Jamun, Jatropha, Pongamia Pinnata, Basil, Pomegranate, Lemon, and Chinar. The images are categorized into healthy 
(2,278 images) and diseased (2,225 images) classes, facilitating research in plant identification, disease detection, and conservation efforts. The images were 
captured in a controlled environment at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, between March and May 2019, using a Nikon D5300 camera with an 18-55mm lens. Each 
image is in .jpg format with sRGB color representation and 24-bit depth.

Usability: This comprehensive collection of leaf images serves as a valuable resource for researchers and academicians focusing on plant identification, classification, 
growth monitoring, and disease diagnosis. The dataset's structured organization into healthy and diseased categories supports the development of machine learning models 
aimed at automated plant health assessment and conservation strategies. The high-quality images and detailed labeling enhance its applicability in various computer vision and botanical studies.



Zenodo Datasets - https://zenodo.org/records/5645731#.Yuehg3ZBxPY

Source: The Pl@ntNet-300K dataset is hosted on Zenodo and can be accessed at https://zenodo.org/record/5645731.

Description: Pl@ntNet-300K is a comprehensive plant image dataset comprising 306,146 images representing 1,081 species. The dataset is characterized by a strong class 
imbalance, with a few species accounting for the majority of images, and high visual similarity among many species, making accurate identification challenging even 
for experts. These features make it particularly suitable for evaluating set-valued classification methods and algorithms. The dataset is organized into three 
subsets: training, validation, and test, each containing images categorized into species-specific subfolders. Accompanying metadata provides detailed information 
for each image, including species identifier, plant organ type (e.g., flower, leaf, bark), author, license, and dataset split. 

Usability: Researchers and developers can utilize Pl@ntNet-300K to train and assess machine learning models for plant species identification, especially in scenarios 
involving class imbalance and high inter-class similarity. The dataset's structure and metadata support the development of advanced classification algorithms and 
set-valued prediction methods. Additionally, utilities for loading the data and training models using PyTorch are available in the associated GitHub repository, 
facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
